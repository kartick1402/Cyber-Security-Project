# Guardian of Azure: Building Expertise in Sentinel and Detection Strategies
In this project we'll be focussing on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
# Topics
-> **Setting up Azure Resources:** Dive into the Azure portal and create essential resources like a Log Analytics Workspace, Virtual Machines, and Azure Sentinel to lay the foundation for your lab.

-> **Enforcing Network and VM Security Best Practices:** Learn the art of fortifying your network and virtual machines with best practices that keep your environment secure against potential threats.

-> **Data Connectors and Data Analysis:** Harness the power of Data Connectors to funnel data into Azure Sentinel for analysis. Discover how these connectors play a pivotal role in gathering insights from diverse sources.

-> **Windows Security Event Logs:** Delve into Windows Security Event logs, unearthing invaluable insights that can provide a deeper understanding of activities within your environment.

-> **Configuring Windows Security Policies:** Uncover the importance of configuring Windows Security Policies as a proactive measure to maintain a resilient security posture.

-> **Mastering Kusto Query Language (KQL):** Embark on a journey through the realm of Kusto Query Language (KQL), acquiring skills to craft powerful queries that extract meaningful information from logs.

-> **Crafting Custom Analytic Rules:** Elevate your expertise by creating custom analytic rules tailored to detect specific Microsoft Security Events, enhancing your detection capabilities.

-> **Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** Explore the renowned MITRE ATT&CK framework, deciphering adversary tactics and techniques. Map these to detection and mitigation procedures for a comprehensive defense strategy.
